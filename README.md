# Date_script.py

This script simulates a dating scenario where the user inputs their date's name and has a conversation about where they want to eat. The user also specifies their budget for the date. The script involves creating a list of menu items and their prices, while allowing the user to input their choice of food from the menu. The script utilizes the `time` and `pandas` imports, as well as if statements and while loops for control flow.

## Imports
